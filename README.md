# Mean_Variance_Portfolio_Optimizer
Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimizer Program

Mean_Var_Port_Optimizer.py is the latest version of this program, and is the one you should look at. mean_var_copy.py is an old version and is used by me as a reference from time to time.

This program is written in Python. It will create a portfolio for the stocks you decide to include, based on a mean-variance framework using 5 years of historical data from Tiingo. It will show you 5 things:

The maximum sharpe-ratio portfolio, the weights of the stocks in the portfolio, and it's expected risk & return.
The minumum variance portfolio, the weights of the stocks in the portfolio, and it's expected risk & return.
A Bar graph showing the risk and return tradeoff for the stocks in your portfolio.
The efficient frontier created with 5000 randomly-weighted portfolios, and where the maximum sharpe portfolio lies.
Optionally, the exact amount of each stock to buy constrained by a user-inputted portfolio value.
